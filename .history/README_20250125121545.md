# AWS Lambda Function: Store Document or PDF in S3 Bucket

This AWS Lambda function allows you to upload a document or PDF file to an Amazon S3 bucket. The function accepts a file through an event (e.g., via API Gateway), processes the file, and stores it in a specified S3 bucket.

## Overview

This Lambda function takes a document or PDF file as input, encodes it using **Base64**, and stores it in a preconfigured S3 bucket. It uses the AWS SDK to interact with Amazon S3.

## Architecture

- **AWS Lambda**: Processes the uploaded file and stores it in an S3 bucket.
- **Amazon S3**: Stores the file uploaded by the Lambda function.
- **Amazon API Gateway** (optional): Can be used to trigger the Lambda function via HTTP requests.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying and running this function, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

1. **AWS Account**: You need an AWS account to create and manage Lambda functions and S3 buckets.
2. **AWS CLI**: Install and configure the AWS CLI for deploying your Lambda functions.
3. **Node.js**: The function is written in Node.js, so you must have it installed.
4. **Amazon S3 Bucket**: Create an S3 bucket in your AWS account that will be used to store the uploaded files.

## Deployment

### Steps to Deploy the Lambda Function:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/upload-to-s3-lambda.git
   cd upload-to-s3-lambda
Install Node.js Dependencies (if any):

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
Create an S3 Bucket:

Go to the AWS Management Console.
Create a new S3 bucket or use an existing one.
Make sure the bucket has the right permissions to allow the Lambda function to upload files.
Create a Lambda Function in the AWS Management Console:

Go to the Lambda console.
Click "Create function."
Choose "Author from scratch."
Set a name (e.g., uploadFileToS3).
Select Node.js as the runtime.
Assign the necessary IAM role with S3 permissions to the Lambda function.
Deploy the Function Code:

In the Lambda console, upload the code (either as a ZIP file or directly using the AWS CLI).
Set the handler to index.handler.
Add Environment Variables (Optional):

Set an environment variable named BUCKET_NAME with the value of your S3 bucket name.
Test the Lambda Function:

You can create a test event in the Lambda console with a JSON payload containing a Base64-encoded file.
Usage
The Lambda function expects a Base64-encoded file to be passed in the event object along with metadata like file name and content type.

Example Request (Event JSON)
You can trigger the Lambda function with the following event JSON (for example, via an API Gateway or testing in Lambda console):

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "fileName": "example.pdf",
  "fileContent": "JVBERi0xLjcKCjEgMCBvYmoKPDwKL1R5cGUgL0NhdGFsb2...Base64-encoded content here...",
  "contentType": "application/pdf"
}
Example Response
If the file upload is successful, you will get a response with the file URL:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "message": "File uploaded successfully!",
  "fileUrl": "https://your-bucket-name.s3.amazonaws.com/example.pdf"
}
Error Handling
In case of errors (e.g., missing input, invalid Base64 encoding), the function returns a descriptive error message with the relevant status code.

Code
javascript
Copy
Edit
const AWS = require('aws-sdk');
const s3 = new AWS.S3();

exports.handler = async (event) => {
    const { fileName, fileContent, contentType } = event;

    if (!fileName || !fileContent || !contentType) {
        return {
            statusCode: 400,
            body: JSON.stringify({ error: 'Missing fileName, fileContent, or contentType.' })
        };
    }

    const bucketName = process.env.BUCKET_NAME || 'your-bucket-name';

    const buffer = Buffer.from(fileContent, 'base64');

    const params = {
        Bucket: bucketName,
        Key: fileName,
        Body: buffer,
        ContentType: contentType
    };

    try {
        await s3.putObject(params).promise();
        const fileUrl = `https://${bucketName}.s3.amazonaws.com/${fileName}`;
        return {
            statusCode: 200,
            body: JSON.stringify({
                message: 'File uploaded successfully!',
                fileUrl: fileUrl
            })
        };
    } catch (error) {
        return {
            statusCode: 500,
            body: JSON.stringify({ error: 'Error uploading file: ' + error.message })
        };
    }
};
S3 Permissions
Make sure the Lambda function's IAM role has the following S3 permissions:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": [
    "s3:PutObject"
  ],
  "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
}
